# D&D 5e Converter Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for improving the D&D 5e Converter project, which aims to convert JSON data files containing D&D 5e content (spells, creatures, and items) into Markdown files for easy reference during gameplay.

## Current State Assessment

The project is in its early stages with minimal implementation:
- Basic project structure is set up
- Main entry point exists but only calls a non-implemented spell parser
- Parser package is defined but lacks actual implementation
- No external dependencies are currently used

## Key Goals

1. **Data Conversion**: Successfully convert JSON files containing D&D 5e data into well-formatted Markdown files
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support all three main data categories (spells, creatures, and items)
3. **Usability**: Generate Markdown files that are easy to read and search during gameplay
4. **Performance**: Process large JSON files efficiently
5. **Maintainability**: Create a codebase that is easy to understand and extend

## Key Constraints

1. **Data Source Structure**: The input data follows a specific structure with index files pointing to content files
2. **JSON Format Variations**: While the general structure is similar, there are variations between different data categories
3. **Special Formatting**: Some JSON fields contain special formatting (e.g., `{@damage 1d6}`) that needs proper conversion
4. **File Organization**: Output files need to be organized in a way that facilitates quick access during gameplay
5. **No UI Required**: No user interface is needed for this project, as another program will be used to search and display the generated Markdown files

## Improvement Plan

### 1. Core Architecture Enhancements

#### 1.1 Parser Interface Redesign
**Rationale**: The current parser implementation is minimal and lacks a clear interface for handling different data types.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Define a common parser interface that can be implemented for each data type
- Create separate implementations for spells, creatures, and items
- Implement a factory pattern to create the appropriate parser based on data type

#### 1.2 Error Handling Framework
**Rationale**: Robust error handling is essential for diagnosing issues with data parsing and conversion.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement structured error types for different failure scenarios
- Add context to errors to help identify which file or entry caused the error
- Create a logging system to track warnings and non-fatal errors

#### 1.3 Configuration System
**Rationale**: A flexible configuration system will make the tool more adaptable to different environments and use cases.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Enhance the Config struct to include more options
- Support configuration via environment variables and/or config file
- Add options for controlling output format, logging level, etc.

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline

#### 2.1 JSON Parsing Implementation
**Rationale**: The core functionality of reading and parsing the JSON files needs to be implemented.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement index file parsing to discover content files
- Create data structures that match the JSON schema for each data type
- Add support for handling variations in JSON structure between different sources

#### 2.2 Markdown Generation
**Rationale**: Converting the parsed data to well-formatted Markdown is a key requirement.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Design Markdown templates for each data type
- Implement template rendering with the parsed data
- Create utility functions for handling special formatting in the JSON data

#### 2.3 File I/O Operations
**Rationale**: Efficient and reliable file operations are necessary for reading input and writing output.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement concurrent file processing where appropriate
- Add progress reporting for long-running operations
- Ensure proper handling of file system errors

### 3. Feature Implementations

#### 3.1 Spell Converter
**Rationale**: The spell converter is the first priority based on the current main.go implementation.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Complete the ParseSpells method implementation
- Handle all spell-specific JSON fields and formatting
- Generate well-structured Markdown for spells with appropriate headers and sections

#### 3.2 Creature Converter
**Rationale**: Converting creature data is a key requirement mentioned in the requirements.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement ParseCreatures method
- Handle creature-specific JSON structure and fields
- Generate Markdown that presents creature stats in an easily readable format

#### 3.3 Item Converter
**Rationale**: Item conversion is the third main data category required.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement ParseItems method
- Handle item-specific JSON structure and fields
- Generate Markdown that presents item information clearly

### 4. Output Organization and Quality

#### 4.1 File Organization Strategy
**Rationale**: The organization of output files will impact how easily they can be searched and accessed.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement a directory structure that logically organizes the output files
- Create index files or tables of contents for easy navigation
- Consider implementing tags or categories for improved searchability

#### 4.2 Markdown Quality Enhancements
**Rationale**: The quality and consistency of the Markdown output will affect its usability.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Ensure consistent formatting across all generated files
- Add metadata headers for improved searchability
- Implement cross-references between related entries
- Adhere to Obsidian's linking syntax (using double brackets like `[[filename]]` or `[[filename|display text]]`) for all references

#### 4.3 Obsidian Compatibility
**Rationale**: Obsidian provides an excellent platform for viewing and navigating Markdown files, with features that enhance the D&D reference experience.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Structure output as an Obsidian vault (a local folder containing Markdown files)
- Leverage Obsidian's data ownership and privacy benefits (all data remains local)
- Support Obsidian's callout/admonition syntax for important information (e.g., `> [!Note]`, `> [!Warning]`)
- Ensure compatibility with Obsidian's navigation and search features
- Organize files to take advantage of Obsidian's graph view for visualizing relationships

#### 4.4 Special Formatting Handling
**Rationale**: The JSON data contains special formatting tags that need proper conversion.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Create a parser for the `{@...}` syntax used in the JSON
- Implement proper conversion of these tags to Markdown
- Handle dice notation, damage types, and other special formatting consistently

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

#### 5.1 Unit Testing Framework
**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing will ensure the reliability of the converter.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement unit tests for all core functionality
- Create test fixtures with sample JSON data
- Add test coverage reporting

#### 5.2 Integration Testing
**Rationale**: End-to-end testing is necessary to verify the complete conversion process.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement integration tests that process sample files end-to-end
- Verify the output Markdown against expected results
- Test with edge cases and malformed input

#### 5.3 Performance Benchmarking
**Rationale**: Performance is important for processing large data sets efficiently.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement benchmarks for key operations
- Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks
- Ensure memory usage remains reasonable for large data sets

## Implementation Priorities

1. Complete the spell converter implementation
2. Implement creature and item converters
3. Enhance output quality and organization
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Optimize performance

## Conclusion

This improvement plan provides a roadmap for developing the D&D 5e Converter into a robust and useful tool. By following this plan, the project will evolve from its current minimal state to a fully functional converter that meets all the requirements specified in the requirements document.

The plan is organized by themes to facilitate focused development efforts, with clear rationales for each proposed change. Implementation priorities are suggested to guide the development process, focusing first on core functionality before moving to enhancements and optimizations.
